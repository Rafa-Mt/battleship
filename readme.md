* Wait for player click in board tile
* Check if is a valid space and hasn't been shot
  * If is empty: the tile is marked in blue
  * If is not empty:  the tile is marked in yellow
  * If a full ship is hit: all the tiles occupied by the ship are marked in red, and a little particle effect is drawn
* Update the number of shots available
* Update the UI
